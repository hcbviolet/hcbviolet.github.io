Blocmetrics is a simple API tracking tool and report generator that can be used to monitor activity on web apps.

This application demonstrates:

- A client-side JavaScript snippet that allows users to track events on their website.
- A server-side API that saves those events to a database.
- CORS to allow the client-side JavaScript to send a request to the API.
- A Rails application that displays the data for a clientâ€™s registered website.
- Customized Devise to allow users to sign in with a username.
- PostgreSQL database
- Deployment using Digital Ocean
