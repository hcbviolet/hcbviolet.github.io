Welcome to the first post of my first blog! If those things weren't momentous enough, this is also my first step out into the developer world. It's good to be here!

In January, after a year and a half of deliberation, I enrolled in Bloc's full-stack web developer program. It's a ~1000hr program with curriculum that guides students through the foundations and then opens up to a series of projects where you get to develop your own applications. I had considered many different code schools, but what made Bloc stand out was the ability to enroll part time, and its mentorship program which pairs students one-on-one with a professional developer who is available to answer questions and keep you on track.

When I began Bloc, my goal was to become a front-end developer for a design firm, but learning Ruby has opened me up to so many more possibilities. I'm about halfway through the Rails portion of the program, and looking forward to working on my own capstone project. I feel really lucky to have found a career path that combines my love of logic, language, and problem-solving, and it's beyond exciting to be learning something I can see myself doing every day.
