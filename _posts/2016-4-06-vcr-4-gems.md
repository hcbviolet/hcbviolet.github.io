title: VCR for Gems with RSpec
---

The VCR gem is a nifty tool to have if you’re testing methods that make API requests. It works by making a real request and then recording it to a cassette, which it can then use in future tests without hitting the API again. That means it can even run offline. Very cool!

I haven’t had the chance to use VCR with Rails yet, but I thought I’d document my experience using it with a gem since there aren’t a ton of resources on this out there.

Here’s how it goes:
Add the gems
Add VCR and Webmock to your gemspec and install gems:

````
  s.add_development_dependency 'vcr'
  s.add_development_dependency 'webmock'
````

Setup VCR
Create two new directories, ```spec/vcr```, where your cassettes will live (this can be named whatever you want), and one named ```spec/support```. In ```spec/support``` create a new file named ```vcr_setup.rb```, which should look something like this:

````
require ‘vcr’
VCR.configure do |c|
#the directory for your cassettes
  c.cassette_library_dir = 'spec/vcr'
#your preferred http request service. Typhoeus and Fakeweb are other options
  c.hook_into :webmock
#if a cassette doesn’t exist, VCR will record a new one
  c.default_cassette_options = {record: :new_episodes}
#integrates VCR with RSpec
  c.configure_rspec_metadata!
end
````

Configure Specs
In your spec file, pass :vcr as an additional argument after the test description (more information [here](https://www.relishapp.com/vcr/vcr/v/2-2-5/docs/test-frameworks/usage-with-rspec-metadata). This will automatically use the description as the cassette name, or you can name them yourself by passing an additional hash like I did:

```
it "returns @auth_token as a string", vcr: {cassette_name: :initialize}  do
  #test
end
```

The first time you run your tests, the api requests will be made and cassettes for each will be stored in the vcr directory, then you can disconnect from the internet and watch them still run. Voila!
